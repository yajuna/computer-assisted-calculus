This repository hosts the jupyter notebooks for computer assisted calculus. You can either launch your notebook by clicking the Google Colab 
badge on the upper left corner of the notebooks, or click this badge for the entire repository: <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/yajuna/computer-assisted-calculus/blob/master">

</a>

Your work will be saved in your Google Drive.

You can also use the Binder project by clicking [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/yajuna/computer-assisted-calculus/HEAD)
But know that you will need to save your work when you are done, as the server will automatically shut down if inactive after 20 minutes.
